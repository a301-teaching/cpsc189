* Assignment 1:

  1) check in a  notebook on a branch called "assign1" that
     uses http://effbot.org/librarybook/os-path/os-path-walk-example-2.py
     described at http://effbot.org/librarybook/os-path.htm to walk a folder
     tree with at least 3 levels printing out all the filenames.  Add comments
     to the function that explain as clearly as possible what each part of the
     code is doing, using a specific example if that helps

  2) Modfiy your function so that it also returns the size of each file, and the
     total size of all files in the directory.  Verify that the total size
     agrees with  windows explorer
